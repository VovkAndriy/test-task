# Everyhero

## Summary

The mayor of Gotham has a huge problem: the city is daily attacked by nasty villains. In the past, the problem could be solved to some extent, because Batman took care of peace in the city. But Batman is now old and frail and lives in a retirement home. The mayor was desperately looking for a replacement, but unfortunately superheroes are hard to find. He therefore had an idea: EveryHero. A digital platform where superheroes can register and showcase their specific skills. This way, the city administration can easily search for their heroes and contact them.

He asks us to implement his idea. The team has already implemented a rough version of the platform. It's now up to you to finish the application.
